TCP/HTTP connection
'''''''''''''''''''
A Mobile Station connects via air interface to 
a Base Station Controller. BSC connects to a 
Server GPRS Support Node. The SGSN connectes to the 
Internal Backbone Network which connects to a 
Gateway GPRS Support Node. The Gateway allows GPRS data to connect to the IP Network. This allows the GPRS can send and recieve 
TCP/HTTP data.


Access to the GPRS network was denied by T-Mobile in the form of 
CMEE-3 ERRORS. CMEE-3 is caused by having an illegal 
Moblie Station.
