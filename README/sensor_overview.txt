DS1631 Tempurature Sensor
'''''''''''''''''''''''''
0x04 is sent to the CONFIG register and 
enables 11 bit resolution and the enables 
continuous conversion. Power could be savedby using the sensor's 1SHOT feature when 
collecting data. The temperature is 
accessed from the DS1631's 2 byte 
temperature register. The tempurature is 
stored as a 16 bit big endian two's complement number.

AVR runs in little endian so a flip is performed inline. 

Software can be updated to enable the DS1631 to store maximum and minimum tempuratures even when power off.

DS1631 can also act as a thermostat. This could drive a tempurature controlled operation.

TCS3490 Light Sensor
''''''''''''''''''''
0x03 is sent to the ENABLE register and activates the ADC and powers the device. 
Light data is stored in 2 byte registers and must be accessed sequentally.

Problem Notes
''''''''
Problem: Temp sens stopped working
Cause:   Address config pins needed to be grounded

Problem: Serial tx pin hangs up
Cause:	 Unknown. flush() seems to help.
