Hardware Improvements
'''''''''''''''''''''
- Analog reset circuit
An analog circuit can monitor the data lines independenty of 
the software. 






Software Improvements
'''''''''''''''''''''
- Power monitoring
The circuit is implemented in hardware. Still needs
to be configured in software.

- Stripping software to metal 
AVR operation is built on Arduino's firmware. The Data Station software makes use of high level libraries what are unnessesary. Software stripping has been achieved in certain areas:

- Building and uploading is done through a Makefile. 
This gives flexabili
