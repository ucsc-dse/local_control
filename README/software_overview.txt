Problem Notes
'''''''''''''
Shortcomings of GSM_Shield library:
    - No way to confirm sim card PIN.

Problem: 
NewSoftSerial.cpp defines a function:
virtual void NewSoftSerial::write(uint8_t)

This function is defined in Print.h as
virtual size_t Print::write(uint8_t)

NewSoftSerial is derived from Print so return types must match.

Solution: 
Changed return type to 
size_t NewSoftSerial::write(uint8_t).

The function did not return anything to begin with so 
I returned 0.
